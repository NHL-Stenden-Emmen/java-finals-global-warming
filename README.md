# Global Warming

## Global description

This program will (probably) fix global warming. At least we try.
We have a lot of causes that cause global warming. For example:

* Cars
* Red meat
* Plastics
* Cows
* Factories
* Construction
* Airplanes
* Deforestation
* Waste of resources
* Fossil fuel

Each cause has an amount of impact on the environment.

Some solutions to fix this are:

* Electric cars
* Eat all the cows
* Produce less meat
* Reduce highway speed
* Use more biodegradable containers
* Green energy -> Windmills, dams, solar panels, nuclear power, bio gas
* Recycling 
* Promote public transport (except planes)
* Afforestation
* Higher taxes (excise/accijns)

Humans are causing the causes. But they can also fix it.

## Input / Output

### What are we going to measure?

The amount of `NO3` and `CO2` a human being is producing.

A human uses transportation, consumes things (meat for example) and produces waste.

All the causes have a certain impact on the environment.

### Output

The human that destroys the earth the most. (string) 

* **Human**
* **Industry** (a collection of Humans)
